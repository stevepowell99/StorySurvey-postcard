# ü¶âStorySurvey

Like SurveyMonkey, for stories. 

Go beyond questionnaires and ‚Äúfree text‚Äù answers. Find out what people are really thinking, in their own words:

- What worked and why?
- What didn‚Äôt work, and why?
- What new issues are emerging?

1Ô∏è‚É£Design and test your StorySurvey interview online. It‚Äôs quick and easy.

2Ô∏è‚É£Send your respondents a link to the interview.

3Ô∏è‚É£Your respondents click on the link. Our friendly AI-interviewer guides them through the whole interview.

4Ô∏è‚É£Download the completed interview transcripts which you can analyse yourself or using our suggested AI qualitative analysis tools.

StorySurvey will be publicly available very soon. [Write to us](mailto:hello@causalmap.app) if you are interested or want to know more, or [join the waiting list](https://forms.wix.com/f/6992844431304950386).

*Qualitative research just got easier.*
