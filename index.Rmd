## What?

**StorySurvey** is like SurveyMonkey for stories. 

An online survey tool which captures people's views about "what causes what?", for example:

- What were the reasons for the successes and failures of the world's response to Covid-19? 

- What were the reasons for the failure of our latest product launch? 

The StorySurvey algorithm will intelligently probe for more reasons behind each answer to get a more complete picture of what causes what.

Many people can fill in the same survey. The app combines the information into a single map which helps visualise common patterns. 

StorySurvey will be publicly available very soon. [Write to us](mailto:hello@causalmap.app) if you are interested or want to know more.
